# CS180_Project 4_Learning_Management_System_059

## Instructions to compile and run the project:

In order to compile the project

Our application start at the main() function in UserClient class, so first of all run main()
If itâ€™s the first time running this application, namely, there is no data stored in a local file, the application will initialize the instances required for the application. If there are local files storing the data, the program will extract data from the local text file and import it into static instances and store them in util.DataManager class (A class we created to store and deal with all the data under to earth)
The menu application begins from now on. By any time during the application, users can choose to quit (or log out if they already logged in). We accomplished this by implementing a 4-level loop in the program.

### Project Description
Our choice is option one, to implement a learning management system discussion board. The Discussion Board gives access to teachers to create discussion forums and allows students to post replies. This discussion board works similar to the discussion boards on brightspace. Teachers are allowed to add, edit and delete courses while students can access the discussion posts and forums within these courses. Our implementation also allows students to vote for the best discussion posts within the forum.

### File Storage

#### UserInfo.txt
The text file that includes all the user data
In the format showing below:
